Amidst all the gates ensuing Apple now, all the focus has gone away from the best release Apple has ever made - not the iPhone XS or XS Max (maybe the Apple Watch 4, but too pricey) , but iOS 12 and macOS Mojave ! I recently got an iPhone SE after my old Moto G4 play started to lag and cause issues, thus moving into the Apple's walled garden completely. I'm now running the latest software release of MacOS on a 3 year old MacBook Air (Early 2015) and iOS a 2 year old iPhone SE (since release) and I've never been happier !

After shifting from Android to iOS, I'll admit that it felt a bit weird but that feeling only lasted so long. Hours into my new phone, I realised how bad the experience on Android was. I got iPhone SE because of it's small screen size and the powerful A9 chip. Every Android phone now has a notch, screen size not less than 5.7 inches, a very fragile screen and glass back - all the factors for a high-maintenance phone and that's why I went with iPhone SE (also, it was pretty cheap).

iOS 12 has given me the smoothest experience on a phone, although it has the first generation TouchID sensor who's lag is a bit noticeable. Now that Mojave is released, the sync between these devices is amazing. The continuity camera feature where photos can directly be imported on to the Mac from the iPhone is the best and taking screenshots on the MacBook now has a whole new experience. The only imperfection with the current iOS is lack of dark mode, hopefully they release it sometime soon making the best device combination ever!

The Mojave release proves why the old Apple products are still worth it in today's high-priced Apple garden, because each update of the macOS has made me happier(from Sierra to High Sierra to now, Mojave), unlike Windows which is a disaster in itself. My MacBook still work flawlessly, my development experience has been crisp and I love the new dark mode ! The only thing I had to worry about the update is the HAXM driver on the new OS, but it works just fine. Hopefully Apple continues the same trend in their software development, although I'd want to see their response for this year's "gates" they're facing for the newly released iPhones - should be hilarious, but is it worth the wait ?
