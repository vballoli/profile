### Recently, I’ve taken up listening to podcasts on Apple Podcasts on my 40 minute commute to the office where I’m pursuing my summer internship and this podcast, The [Lex Fridman’s podcasts on Artificial Intelligence](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4) caught my attention.

 I particularly like this podcast is because the host, Lex Fridman explores the minds of the best researchers in CS by talking about their take on the world of technology, both scientifically and philosophically. The guests on this podcasts are people who’s papers and blog posts I’ve been reading and following and their views are inspiring and also conflicting because that makes me question myself on what I think about the very same topics. Although I haven’t listened to all of them, some of them have impacted me deeply on the way I perceive the world and the world of tech:

### Dr. Greg Brockman, OpenAI(founder, founder Stripe)

### Dr. Rosalind Picard, MIT

### Dr. Chris Lattner, Google (former Apple, Tesla)

### Dr. Ian Goodfellow, Apple (author of GAN)

### Dr. Oriol Vinyals, AlphaStar - Deepmind (former Google Brain)

### Elon Musk

### Kai-Fu Lee (Author of AI Superpower)

All these people have talked about AGI (Dr. Brockman), Affective computing (Dr. Picard), various aspects of deep learning -  progress, future, limits, opportunities, advancements, etc. These topics are particularly interesting because no one discusses them in scientific papers and various communities which ideally should be important so that everyone has a fair idea about where the field, it’s current and potential impact irrespective of their profession. I particularly liked the Elon Musk podcast because I really liked the confidence behind every statement and for the most of it, I did agree - specially the one segment which involved how the people and governments see regulating self-driving cars and why they are required. At one particular instance Elon Musk illustrates his point on human's vigilance in the self-driving car's performance:

> You wouldn't want some human to operate an elevator through levers, you would rather have the elevator stop automatically through buttons. That's obviously safer....  In the future, people will be like "I can't believe humans were allowed to drive a 2 ton death machine by themselves." 

These words seem wrong and almost arrogant, but if you really think about it, it's true! All of these episodes have a similar tone and these have exposed me to new ideas and paradigms. I do recommend watching/listening to all of these while I finish listening to the remaining episodes.
