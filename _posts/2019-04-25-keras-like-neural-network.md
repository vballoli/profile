Assignment 3: Implement an ANN - I went all Kerasy !!!

This semester I'm enrolled in the BITS F464 Machine Learning course and the third assignment was to implement a neural network. The concepts were pretty clear and so was the implementation. But I wanted it to take it a level up, so I decided I wanted to do it in a Â sequential fashion like Keras. I felt the effort for this deserved a post!

First off, I started with implementing it in C++ so that I could brush up my basics in it and learn more about it and it seemed the perfect way to do it. Although the Bishop's mathematical explanation was clear, I had to derive the equations myself to get a clear picture of how the code should look like. So I did it: wrote the code for a "neuron" class and then the neural network class: the problem was a clang error popped up and I couldn't find any solution on the good ol' StackOverflow. I now had a hard deadline approaching ...

I immediately switched to Python - something I'm very comfortable with: the core code was intact but overall it was a pretty shabby implementation, but I feel pretty satisfied in the end. If I ever find the time, I'll definitely clean the code and structure it better to give it a good finishing.
