I recently published a research paper titled "Video Streaming using Scalable Video Coding over Opportunistic Networks" under my mentor and former professor at CS&IS Dept., BITS Pilani Hyderabad, Â Mr. Abhishek Thakur and [Arnav Dhamija](www.arnavdhamija.com) (one of the best people I've met in college), and got an opportunity to present it at an IEEE conference [WiSPNET 2019](http://wispnet2019.org) at SSN Engineering College, Chennai. 

I enjoyed the travel as much as I enjoyed while presenting the paper. This being my first time travelling alone in an unknown city, I had a constant fear of being stuck in the middle of nowhere and missing my presentation. But, I only have praise for the public transport in Chennai. I could reach anywhere in the public buses and never felt the need to book a cab and the people around were quite friendly even though the language barrier was an issue. 

I reached quite comfortably after getting down at Egmore, Chennai and switched 3 buses to reach the college. After checking in with the organizers, I quickly changed and hurried back so that I could attend the talks scheduled for the rest of the day. Although the talks were really good, I could only understand a part of Dr. Tolga Duman and Dr. Giovanni Schembra's talks. In Dr. Schembra's talk about "The Key enablers of 5G ecosystem", he talked about Network Softwarization, Virtualization, Resource management and orchestration extensively which was a pretty good introduction for the 5G architecture I suppose. The one thing that struck me was his conclusion of the talk where he says everyone must learn about Artificial Intelligence irrespective of their field of study, supporting it by claiming that the 6G network architecture would be fully AI controlled.

Fast forward to the presentation, it was T-5 minutes and I had a terrible headache. I tried staying calm to avoid any panic. At the beginning of my presentation, there was a mishap - the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0gCMIiJdYPQ) I had embedded didn't start automatically as it should have and I ended up explaining it manually using a still image of the inter-planetary illustration in the image which was so simply shown in the video. Everything was smooth later on and felt good at the end of presentation, although there weren't many people in the audience. Ending my day with a decent dinner and an episode of Billions, I hopped onto the flight back scheduled in the afternoon next day. The whole week was a roller coaster ride from preparing the presentation in the last 3 days to travelling and presenting at the conference and ending with concerts of Pineapple Express and Vishal-Shekhar - couldn't have asked for more!
