While I was studying, rather exploring more about Reinforcement Learning, I suddenly felt the urge to cook and I don't know why, the first thing that struck me was mushroom. Mom was surprised and glad at the same time, can't say which one though but she suggested I make the "Shahi Mushroom" curry !

It wasn't tough to be honest - but it did involve a lot of spices which I've never used. I searched for the recipe and the first link was this from [NDTV](https://food.ndtv.com/recipe-shahi-mushroom-233314) - so I followed it, but not exactly. Mom was monitoring me and when I showed her the recipe - she condensed a 10 step procedure into 3 with a simple philosophy: mix everything in the beginning to ease things. After that, it was all grinding, frying and mixing. In the end, it did look like this:

It was good - but that's a biased opinion ðŸ˜„. Looking forward to learn more, or rather survive after cooking them I suppose.
