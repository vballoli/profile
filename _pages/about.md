Hi! I'm Vaibhav Balloli, final year undergraduate at BITS Pilani, Hyderabad Campus studying Electronics and Communication Engineering. 

My academic interests include Machine Learning, Reinforcement Learning, Systems and Networks, Computer Architecture and their intersections. I play guitar, read fiction, listen to podcasts(special mention: [Lex Fridman AI podcasts](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrAXtmErZgOdP_8GztsuKi9nrraNbKKp4)), spend time on Twitter and YouTube following and reading about various researchers and their research projects, mostly in the field of Deep Learning(special mention: [MSR](https://www.youtube.com/user/MicrosoftResearch), [Two Minute Papers](https://www.youtube.com/user/keeroyz), [Yannic Kilcher](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZHmQk67mSJgfCCTn7xBfew)). I often write articles on my [personal blog](https://vballoli.github.io) about various things and enjoy talking about movies, tv series, machine learning and hardware.

Iâ€™m currently looking for opportunities to pursue research/work in Machine Learning, Computer Vision, Hardware Systems and their intersection.
